  module: "MMM-GooglePhotos",
  position: "top_right",
  config: {
		albums: [], // Set your album name. like ["My wedding", "family share", "Travle to Paris"]
		updateInterval: 1000 * 60, // minimum 10 seconds.
		sort: "new", // "old", "random"
		uploadAlbum: null, // Only album created by `create_uploadable_album.js`.
		condition: {
			fromDate: null, // Or "2018-03", RFC ... format available
			toDate: null, // Or "2019-12-25",
			minWidth: null, // Or 400
			maxWidth: null, // Or 8000
			minHeight: null, // Or 400
			maxHeight: null, // Or 8000
			minWHRatio: null,
			maxWHRatio: null,
			// WHRatio = Width/Height ratio ( ==1 : Squared Photo,   < 1 : Portraited Photo, > 1 : Landscaped Photo)
		},
		showWidth: 1080, // These values will be used for quality of downloaded photos to show. real size to show in your MagicMirror region is recommended.
		showHeight: 1920,
		timeFormat: "YYYY/MM/DD HH:mm", // Or `relative` can be used.
  }
},
```

## Usage
#### **`albums`**
Now this module can access not only your owns but also shared. You can specify album title like this.
```js
albums: ["My wedding", "family share", "Travle to Paris", "from Tom"],
```
- Caution. Too many albums and photos could make long bootup delay.
- Remember this. You can only show max 8640 photos in a day. Manage your album what to show, it will make better performance.

#### **`updateInterval`**
- Minimum `updateInterval` is 10 seconds. Too often update could makes API quota drains or network burden.

#### **`sort`**
- `new`, `old`, `random` are supported.

#### **`uploadAlbum`**
- If you set this, you can upload pictures from MagicMirror to Google Photos through `GPHOTO_UPLOAD` notification.
```js
this.sendNotification('GPHOTO_UPLOAD', path)
```
- This album **SHOULD** be created by `create_uploadable_album.js`.
```sh
node create_uploadable_album.js MyMagicMirrorAlbum
```
- At this moment, `MMM-Selfieshot` and `MMM-TelegramBot` can upload their pictures through this feature.

#### **`condition`**
- You can filter photos by this object.
- `fromDate` : If set, The photos which was created after this value will be loaded. (e.g: `fromDate:"2015-12-25"` or `fromDate:"6 Mar 17 21:22 UT"`)
- `toDate` : If set, The photos which was created before this value will be loaded. (e.g: `toDate:"Mon 06 Mar 2017 21:22:23 z"` or `toDate:"20130208"`)
- ISO 8601 and RFC 2822 is supported for `fromDate` and `toDate`.
- `minWidth`, `maxWidth`, `minHeight`, `maxHeight` : If set, the photos have these value as original dimensiont will be loaded. You can use these values to avoid too big or too small pictures(like icons)
- `minWHRatio`, `maxWHRatio` : With these values, you can get only portrait photos(or landscaped, or squared)
- **WHRatio** is `width / height`. So `=1` will be squared dimension. `>1` will be landscaped. `<1` will be portrait.
- Example:
```js
condition: {
	fromDate: "2018-01-01", // I don't want older photos than this.
	minWidth: 600, // I don't want to display some icons or meme-pictures from my garbage collecting albums.
	maxWHRatio: 1, // I want to display photos which are portrait.
}
```

#### **`showWidth`, `showHeight`**
- Specify your real resolution to show.

#### **`timeFormat`**
- Specify time format for photo info. You can also use `relative` to show more humanized.

#### **`debug`**
- If set, more detailed info will be logged.

#### **`autoInfoPosition`**
- For preventing LCD burning, Photo info can be relocated by condition.
  	- `true` : automatically change position to each corner per 15 minutes.
		- `false` : not using.
		- callbackfunction (album, photo) : User can make his own position. It should return `[top, left, bottom, right]`
```js
autoInfoPosition: true, // or false

// User custom callback
autoInfoPosition: (album, photo)=> {
 return ['10px', '10px', 'none', 'none'] // This will show photo info top-left corner.
}

```



## Tip.
- Not to show photo info : Add this into your `css/custom.css`.
```css
#GPHOTO_INFO {
	display:none;
}
```

- To move photo info to other position (e.g: top-left corner): Add this into your `css/custom.css`.
```css
#GPHOTO_INFO {
  top: 10px;
  left: 10px;
  bottom: inherit;
  right: inherit;
}
```

- Not to show blurred Background : Add this into your `css/custom.css`.
```css
#GPHOTO_BACK {
	display:none;
}
```

- To cover whole region with image : Add this into your `css/custom.css`.
```css
#GPHOTO_CURRENT {
	background-size:cover;
}
```

- To shrink image and be fully visible on smaller screens : Add this into your `css/custom.css`.
```css
#GPHOTO_CURRENT {
	background-size:contain;
}
```

- To display `clock` more clearly on showing in `fullscreen_below` : Add this into your `css/custom.css`.
```css
.clock {
  padding: 10px;
	background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);
}
```

- To give opacity to photos:
```CSS
@keyframes trans {
  from {opacity: 0}
  to {opacity: 0.5}
}
#GPHOTO_CURRENT {
  background-size:cover;
  opacity:0.5;
}
```

## Notice
- First scanning will take a few (~dozens) seconds. Don't panic.
- If there are 1000s of photos, this scan could take minutes(over 10). longer scans increase the probablity of an error happening. If a single error happens in the scan, it will retry after 1 hour. After first successful scan, subsequent startups should go very quickly(seconds).

## Last Tested;
- MagicMirror : v2.24.0
- node.js : required over v16.
